  <h2><strong>Project Description: Clusters of Success - Enhancing Stock Analysis through K-Means</strong></h2>

<p>This project delves into the realm of stock market analysis, focusing on the application of K-Means clustering to discern distinct groups of stocks based on their Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Average True Range (ATR) values. Below is a detailed overview of the project:</p>

<h3><strong>Objective:</strong></h3>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to employ K-Means clustering to categorize stocks into cohesive groups according to their RSI and ATR metrics. By doing so, we aim to gain insights into the market landscape, identify patterns, and potentially uncover actionable investment opportunities within these clusters.</p>

<h3><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data for the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance, covering a range of stocks from the NIFTY 50 index.</li>
  <li>Features such as RSI and ATR are computed using technical analysis indicators to gauge the momentum and volatility of each stock.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Interpretation of Clusters:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each cluster is analyzed to derive meaningful insights into the characteristics of the stocks within.</li>
  <li>Mean RSI and ATR values are computed for each cluster to understand the average momentum and volatility levels.</li>
  <li>Interpretations are provided for each cluster, offering insights into potential investment strategies and market conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Silhouette Score and Calinski-Harabasz Index are utilized to evaluate the quality and coherence of the resulting clusters, providing quantitative measures of cluster separation and compactness.</li>
</ul>
